# Website Template

Thie is a simple mobile first fully responsive HTML5/CSS3 website starter template with sticky navigation menu, based largely on the [Barebones CSS](https://acahir.github.io/Barebones/) and [Skeleton CSS](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) frameworks.

It allows for simple override of default primary colors, grid max-width and media queries.
