# Website Template

This is a simple mobile first fully responsive HTML5/ CSS3 and JavaScript website starter template with a responsive sticky navigation menu, although the navigation menu can also be easily set to fixed (i.e. with sticky properties removed).

The CSS look and feel (i.e. the styling of the template) is based on the [Barebones CSS](https://acahir.github.io/Barebones/) and [Skeleton CSS](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) frameworks, but the custom style.css file allows for simple overrides for default primary colors, grid max-width, media queries etc.

The default media query break point is set at 920px in both the barebones.css and the custom style.css files and can be easily changed or amended with further breakpoints if required.
